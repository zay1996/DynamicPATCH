# DynamicPATCH

A Python package for Dynamic PAtch Transition CHaracterization in explicit space (DynamicPATCH)
================================================================================================
DynamicPATCH is a patch-based method that characterizes and quantifies eight types of mutually exclusive and collectively exaustive transition patterns: Appearing, Disappearing, Merging, Splitting, Filling, Perforating, Expanding, and Contracting. DynamicPATCH also computes gross changes in both area and number of patches. See more details about our method in our upcoming manuscript: Zhang et al. (2024)
